- Define circuit.start
- Change to rear wheel drive?
- Program health
- LENGTH_NEXT AND CURVATURE(_NEXT) SHOULD ONLY BE UPDATED WHEN A NEW SEGMENT IS ENTERED
	# length_future[reached_next_checkpoint,:] = np.column_stack(length_future[reached_next_checkpoint,1:], new_column)
	# curvature_future[reached_next_checkpoint,:] = np.column_stack(curvature_future[reached_next_checkpoint,1:], new_column)
- Add punishments as counters
- Check length_future and curvature_future by printing
